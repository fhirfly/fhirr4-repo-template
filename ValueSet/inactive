This contrasts with expectation, which is a prediction that something will happen in the future. GOL (goal) reflects a hope rather than a prediction.

This contrasts with goal which doesn't represent an intention to act, merely a hope for an eventual result. A goal is distinct from the intended actions to reach that goal. &quot;I will reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg&quot; is an intent. &quot;I hope to be able to get the patient to the point where I can reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg&quot; is a goal.

A risk factor that is present (e.g. obesity, smoking, etc) should be expressed in event mood. INT (intent) reflects a plan for the future, which is a declaration to do something. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that may or may not ever happen. GOL (goal) reflects a hope to achieve something. EXPEC (expectation) is the prediction of a positive or negative event. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that may or may not ever happen, and may not be expected to happen.</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n          <td>\r\n            <a name=\"http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActMood-OPT\"> </a>1\r\n          </td>\r\n          <td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00C2\u00A0\u00C2\u00A0\r\n            <a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/CodeSystem-v3-ActMood.html#v3-ActMood-OPT\">OPT</a>\r\n          </td>\r\n          <td>option</td>\r\n          <td>**Definition:** One of a set of acts that specify an option for the property values that the parent act may have.
